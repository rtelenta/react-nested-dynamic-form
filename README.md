# React Nested Dynamic Form

## Getting Started 📋

This project shows you how to create a form in _React_ with nested components and dynamic fields.

Note: The components can be organized in a better way but the current organization is an excuse to use a _FormProvider_ from _React hook form_

[DEMO](https://rtelenta.github.io/react-nested-dynamic-form/)
